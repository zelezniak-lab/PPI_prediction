6. LSTM-PHV: prediction of human-virus protein-protein interactions by LSTM with word2vec:<br/>
<pre>
    a.Here we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29
	  SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identifed the human proteins that physically
	  associated with each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins using afnity-purifcation mass spectrometry,
	  identifying 332 high-confdence proteinâ€“protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins
	b. Database: HPIDB 3.0
	        How dataset was created?
				--> MI score >= 0.3 are kept. MI score is the confidence score assigned to each PPI from <b>Intact</b> and <b>VirHostnet</b>
				--> Redundant PPIs were excluded by using CD-HIIT with an identity threshold of 0.95
				--> Removed proteins of length less than 30 and more than 1000<b>(30 <= len(proteins) <= 1000)</b>
	c. Negative sampling:
			Dissimilarity based negative sampling method: Read Denovo paper and this paper again for full understanding
														Really nice way to do it
	d. Dataset size: 22,383 positive pairs (5882 human and 996 virus proteins) from HPIDB 
					 7371 positive pairs of SARS-cov3 and human  from BIOGRID(Covid-19 coronavirus project 4.3.195)	
					 8412 PPis human and nonviral pathogens (3317 human proteins and 3068 virus proteins)(only for testing)
	e. Dataset and API: http://kurata35.bio.kyutech.ac.jp/LSTM-PHV/introduction_page
	f. Model:  LSTM-->Concatante --> FC -->prediction
				Weighted cross entropy to deal with imbalance dataset, early stopping
	g. Metrics used to evaluate: MCC,F1,AUPRC,ACC, SN,SP
